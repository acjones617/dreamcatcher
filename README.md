## Welcome to Dreamcatcher.

I built Dreamcatcher as part of a two-day hackathon. 

Dreamcatcher is currently a web app prototype that allows people to broadcast their
dreams and aspiration in a safe, anonymous forum and browse those of others. The hope is to
provide an exchange where we can inspire and be inspired. Additionally, if one is in a unique
circumstance to fulfill someone else's dream they stumbles upon while browsing, they can reach out
with a message, offering to help.

### Made With...

Dreamcatcher was developed as an Angular app with a Firebase backend during the prototyping stage.
If I continue to build out this idea, the next step would be to do a major overhaul of the Angular code,
and to build out the express.js API with either a SQL database.

#### [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/): 

A structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend          HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

#### [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/): 

An API to store and sync data in realtime.
